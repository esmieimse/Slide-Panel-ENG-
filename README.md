It can display images or text, or both like below.

The article explaining how to use [Japanese]: https://esmie.hateblo.jp/entry/slide-panel  
You can use Google translation by right-clicking, it may be a little hard to read, though.

I have written some comments in the code, so if you know a some HTML/CSS, you don't need to check the article.  
All the customizable parts are in the HTML file (slide-panel.html), so basically you have no need to edit CSS and JavaScript files.
